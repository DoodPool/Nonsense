                with the birth and growth of the internet, the pre-existing notion of "counter culture" has had its
                walls
                slowly torn down. there is, in essence, no more counter culture in this day and age.
            </p>
            <p class="tx-upper">
                instead, there is a growing population of free-thinkers, self-expression and wandering minds that have
                been
                reborn into a realm of "controlled cultural chaos". nonsense aims to be the brand that represents this
                ideology and be the face of representation to this new culture in a current, relevant and stylish way.
